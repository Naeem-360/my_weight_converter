This simple Python program converts a user's weight between kilograms and pounds.
It prompts the user to input their weight and specify the unit: "K" for kilograms or "L" for pounds. 
Based on the selected unit, it either multiplies or divides the weight by 0.45 to perform the conversion and displays the result.
